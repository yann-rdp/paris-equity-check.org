    "6a": "It is important to Switzerland that the global community shares the required efforts to combat global climate change in a fair and equitable manner. The same rules must apply to all Parties, while the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be differentiated according to a Party’s responsibility and capacity.<br>Switzerland’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least50 percent by 2030 relative to 1990 levels puts Switzerland on an emission development pathway in line with the recommendations by science to keep average global temperature increase to1.5 degrees Celsius.<br>Switzerland’s emission reductions by 2030 will mainly be achieved domestically, thereby further strengthening Switzerland’s transition to a low carbon economy. Given the low green-house gas intensity of Switzerland today, this NDC represents a high level of ambition for 2030.<br>Switzerland pursues its emission reduction efforts, giving due consideration for fairness and equity. Fairness considerations include various aspects. No single aspect on its own can accurately reflect fairness. The evolving nature of a country’s circumstances should also be reflected in fairness considerations.<br>Switzerland’s understanding of a fair share includes in particular consideration of the aspects below. <br>- Responsibility is reflected in a country’s past, current and future greenhouse gas emissions. Total emissions as well as per capita emissions are to be considered. Today, Switzerland emits around 0.1percentof world’s emissions and per capita emissions are below world’s average. Through climate policies implemented domestically, Switzerland’s total share in global emissions as well as per capita emissions continue to decrease despite a substantial growth in industrial production (1990 –today: +75.1 percent) and population (1990 –today: +27.1 percent). Switzerland has a low level of historic emissions, contributing less than 0.2 percent of cumulative global emissions from1990 to 2014. [WRI’s climate watch data (https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions).]<br>- Capacity to contribute to solving the climate problem is closely related to the ability to invest in appropriate mitigation measures, such as carbon-efficient technologies. Hence, one aspect of capacity is to take into account GDP per capita in fairness considerations. Another core aspect in considering a fair contribution of a country are cost-efficient mitigation potential and abatement costs. Abatement costs vary strongly across countries. It is also to note that marginal abatement costs increase if a country has under-taken ambitious mitigation actions in the past. In fairness considerations, it is important to consider past efforts and early movers. In Switzerland, GDP per capita is high, signifying high ability to invest. At the same time, abatement costs are also high due to the limited availability of short-term cost-efficient mitigation potential: Switzerland’s energy production is nearly carbon free and there is little heavy industry. Territorial emission reduction potential mostly remains in the buildings and transport sectors. This remaining potential has long transformation periods.<br>Based on equity considerations outlined above, Switzerland is committed to strongly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with emission reduction pathways that keep the increase in global average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Switzerland stays committed to continue the fight against climate change at the forefront of international action.<br>In the interest of timely climate action and as an addition to domestic actions, Switzerland intends to use Article 6 activities, contributing to the overall emission reduction target of at least minus 50 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. <br>Under the thirdCO2 Act, which is subject to a facultative referendum, Switzerland is aiming to reduce additional emissions abroad that occurred during the production of goods abroad, imported to Switzerland and therefore not counted towards Switzerland’s emissions reductions objectives. According to the law these emission reductions should correspond as far as possible to the emissions imported to Switzerland through goods produced abroad. The reduction of these emissions will be triggered through the Swiss Climate Fund, newly established under the third CO2 Act, to be sourced in part by a share of the revenues generated by the CO2 levy and a newly established levy on private and business aviation.",

    "6c": "Article 4, paragraph 3 of the Paris Agreement provides that each Party’s NDC will present a progression beyond the Party’s then current NDC and reflect its highest possible ambition. Switzerland’s NDC reflects a progression of effort compared with its communication submitted in October 2017. Given the clean energy mix in Switzerland, mitigation opportunities remaining are at high costs. The third CO2 Act adopted by Parliament stipulates an overall emission re-duction target of at least minus 50 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, of which at least three-quarters or 75 percent of the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions must be achieved through measures implemented in Switzerland. This represents a progression from the previous, second CO2Act, which foresaw that at least 60 percent of the reduction in green-house gas emissions were to be achieved by measures taken in Switzerland. Considerable efforts are needed to reach the target. In this regard, Switzerland has continuously increased the rate of the CO2levy on heating and processes fuels, reaching a rate of 96 Swiss francs per tonne of CO2(about 99 US dollars per tonne of CO2) since 2018.The thirdCO2Act allows this rate –while already being one of the highest worldwide –to further increase up to a maximum of 210 Swiss francs per tonne of CO2in the coming years. Indeed, a ratcheting-up mechanism automatically increases the rate of the CO2levy on heating and process fuels if intermediate targets are not met. <br>In addition to domestic efforts, and given Switzerland is a high-income country, Article 6 activities will be used to complement domestic actions contributing to the overall emission reduction target of at least minus 50percentby 2030 compared with1990 levels. <br>Furthermore, the enhanced NDC also reflects the decision by the Swiss Government to aim for a climate neutral Switzerland by 2050. In doing so, Switzerland strengthens its efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to contribute to the internationally agreed objective of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius when compared with the pre-industrial era. <br>In addition, under the third CO2 Act, which is subject to a facultative referendum, Switzerland is aiming to reduce additional emissions abroad that are not counted towards Switzerland’s emissions reductions objectives, but which contribute to limiting the global temperature in-crease in accordance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. According to the law they should correspond as far as possible to Switzerland’s imported “grey” emissions.<br>The updated and enhanced NDC therefore represents a progression in several areas:<br>- a progression of the NDC from minus 50 percent by 2030 to at least minus 50 percent by 2030compared to 1990 levels;<br>- an increase of the indicative goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero emissions by 2050 (compared to the previous objective of minus 70 to 85 percent by 2050 compared to 1990);<br>- a 25 percent increase of the domestic share of emission reductions, from 60 percent to at least 75 percent;<br>- compensation of imported “grey” emissions through additional emission reductions abroad, not counted towards Switzerland’s emission reductions objectives;<br><br>Finally, Switzerland applies the guidance adopted at COP-24in Katowice.",

The formulated commitment by 2030 is further consistent with the longer term aim of the Swiss Government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. In order to reach net zero emissions, technologies that permanently remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and store them are to be used in the future to some extent. It is to note that Switzerland’s per capita emissions were already at world average levels in 2006."

Under such circumstances, significant reduction of GHG emissions without undermining national economic growth is a challenging task. <br>However, the GHG emissions level that had been on the continuous rise since the1990s started decreasing from 2018, the year the level is to expected to peak. This is mainly because the Republic of Korea’s active mitigation measures aiming at decoupling economic growth from GHG emissions have begun to take effect. The measures include the ban on construction of new coal-fired power plants and the launch of the K-ETS, the world’s largest carbon trading system operated at national level. The K-ETS has started its operation since 2015. From 2021 to 2030, the scheme aims to achieve the updated NDC in accordance with the 3rd Basic Plan for the K-ETS. The emissions cap in the Phase 3 Allocation Plan was also recently set in accordance with the updated NDC. <br>To accelerate the momentum gathered so far, the Republic of Korea has set the ambitious level of reduction target, which is to cut the total national GHG emissions by one-fourth within approximately10 years from the base year, 2017.<br>The Republic of Korea plans to significantly scale up R&D investments for core emissions reduction technologies, e.g., renewable energy, zero emission vehicles and hydrogen technologies, under the recognition that climate change is caused by man-made GHG emissions and therefore, it could be dealt with by human endeavor as well, i.e., the technological development. The government is also pushing ahead with the Korean Green New Deal from 2020with the planned investment of KRW 73.4 trillion to overcome the climate crisis and economic recession.",
    "6b": "The Republic of Korea began its industrialization in the 1970s. Under its drive for economic growth, the Republic of Korea has experienced continued GHG emissions growth since the 1990s. However, with its Energy & GHG Target Management System, K-ETS, and other active mitigation policies starting to take effect, the emissions level is expected to start decreasing from2019 after 2018, the year the level is expected to peak.<br>Under such circumstances, the Republic of Korea, expecting its emissions level in 2018to be its peak, has set the ambitious target, which is to cut the total national GHG emissions by one-fourth within approximately 10 years from 2018. This duration of nearly 10 years is much shorter time span than most developed countries have taken to reduce their emissions by one-fourth and therefore, it is our understanding that the Republic of Korea is making a fair contribution to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.<br>President Moon Jae-in declared in his speech on annual budget at the National Assembly in October2020that the Republic of Korea will strive to become carbon-neutral by 2050. Although the Republic of Korea experienced industrialization at a later stage, his speech reaffirmed the Republic of Korea’s commitment to striving to achieve the same2050goal indicated in the IPCC Special Report on the Global Warming of 1.5°C. With such long-term goal in mind, the Korean government will seriously consider raising ambition level in its NDC before 2025. ",
    "6c": "The Republic of Korea added GHGreductionpathwaysona3-year basis to the 2030 Roadmap, except 2030, the target year. This is to provide clear policy signals so that the indicated pathways could be used as a guidance for setting the emissions caps for the K-ETS. Also, the share of overseas reduction in the 2030 Roadmap has been reduced to strengthen domestic mitigation efforts.<br>Building upon such progress, the government updated the existing target to the absolute target, which is to reduce 24.4% from the total national GHG emissions in 2017 by 2030, to increase clarity and transparency of the target. The Enforcement Decree of the Framework Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth was amended to include the updated target, ensuring the legal basis for mitigation efforts.",
    "6d": "The Republic of Korea has set the economy-wide absolute emissions reduction target in its updated NDC. The absolute target provides an enhanced clarity and transparency in terms of target emissions and emissions reduction rates compared to the other target-setting methods, i.e., emissions intensity target or BAU-based reduction target. <br>The update of NDC into the economy-wide absolute emissions reduction target indicates the Republic of Korea’s strong commitment to reducing further GHG emissions, especially considering evolving circumstances that can be triggered by changing economic growth rate and industrial structure. <br>Article 4, paragraph 4 of the Paris Agreement encourages developing countries to move over time towards economy-wide emissions reduction or limitation targets. With this in mind, the Republic of Korea converted the existing BAU-based reduction target, previously communicated in its INDC, into the absolute target, which indicates a meaningful progress.",

    "7a": "Article 2 of the UNFCCC sets forth its ultimate objective to achieve stabilization of GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. This objective was later stated more specifically in the Paris Agreement as its goal to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. To achieve this goal, Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Paris Agreement further states that a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of GHGs should be achieved in the second half of this century. The Republic of Korea updated the NDC in consideration of this long-term global goal of the Paris Agreement, and therefore, the Republic of Korea’s updated NDC contributes to achieving the ultimate goal of the UNFCCC.",

The Green New Deal is underpinned by 3 key pillars; green transition in cities/spatial planning/living infrastructure, diffusion of low-carbon and distributed energy, and establishment of innovative green industry ecosystems.

    "Country": "Singapore",
    "6a": "The updated NDC and the accompanying information reflects Singapore’s commitment under the Paris Agreement in support of the multilateral framework of cooperation to address climate change. In particular, the updated NDC reflects the following enhancements:<br>a) An economy-wide absolute GHG emissions limitation target in place of the previous intensity target. This will provide greater clarity and transparency of Singapore’s emissions level in 2030 and facilitate the tracking of progress; <br>b) A clear peaking level (i.e. 65 MtCO2e) around 2030. This reflects Singapore’s efforts to support the objectives of Article 2a and Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement. This is a challenging and ambitious target given Singapore’s national circumstances and anticipated growth in economic activity;<br>a. c)Inclusion ofNF3. With this inclusion, the coverage of gases in Singapore’s NDC has been expanded to include all seven gases within the same peaking level. This reflects an increase in the ambition of Singapore’s NDC and will require additional mitigation effort;<br>c) Methodological updates to Singapore's NDC. These updates include, for example, the use ofthe2006 IPCC Guidelines and the 100-year time-horizon GWP values from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. This demonstrates enhanced transparency in the reporting of Singapore’s national inventory and climate actions;<br>d) Updated information on implementation efforts. These efforts include more ambitious solar energy goals and the introduction of an economy-wide carbon tax with no exemptions for covered facilities; and<br>e) Application of ICTU guidance. This will facilitate greater clarity, transparency and understanding of Singapore’s NDC and implementation efforts.<br>Consideration of the fairness and ambition of Singapore’s NDC must take into account the following:<br>a) Singapore has taken ambitious early actions. Singapore made early policy choices that reduced its GHG emissions, for example by switching from fuel oil to natural gas –the cleanest form of fossil fuel –for power generation. In 2019, about 95% of its electricity was generated from natural gas, compared to 18% in 2000. Energy is priced at market cost, without any subsidy, so that households and businesses will use energy judiciously. Singapore was the first country to impose a vehicle quota system to cap vehicle growth, and the only country to set a zero growth rate for cars and motorcycles. As a result, these and other earlier initiatives make it harder for Singapore to achieve steep emissions reductions because many of the gains have already been reaped through early action over the years;<br>b) Singapore is alternative energy disadvantaged. Singapore’s urban density and limited land area (725km2), relatively flat land, low wind speeds and lack of geothermal resources present serious difficulties in pursuing alternative energy options. Its limited land resources also make it challenging to deploy solar power on a large scale. Given Singapore’s small land area and high population density, the risks of nuclear energy currently outweigh the potential benefits. Such circumstances are recognised under Article 4, paragraph 10 of the UNFCCC;<br>c) Singapore has one of the highest population densities globally. Singapore has one of the highest population densities in the world (7,866 persons per km2). In addition, as a low-lying island state of 725 km² with no natural resources, Singapore has to accommodate not only housing and commercial centres, but also power plants, reservoirs, air/seaports and industries within its city boundaries. The limited land space and high urban density mean that there is limited scope for solar photovoltaics (PV)deployment and for the forestry sector to be a significant carbon sink;<br>d) Singapore is dependent on the global supply chain for food and energy security. As one of the most globalised economies and a trading nation with no indigenous resources, Singapore is heavily dependent on the global supply chain for its food and energy security. Its economic activity and emissions are also highly sensitive to the volatility of regional and global developments. These challenges mean that Singapore’s climate strategies have to take into account international developments that may adversely affect its economy, and its food and energy security;<br>e) Singapore is one of the top performers for carbon intensity globally. While Singapore’s share of the global GDP is small at 0.4%, as an advanced manufacturing hub it plays a key role to meet the demands of the region and the world, accounting for 2.1% of the world’s total merchandise exports.2Energy efficiency is a key strategy for emissions reduction and Singapore aims to produce goods in an energy-and carbon-efficient manner. As energy costs are not subsidised in Singapore, companies are incentivised to use energy judiciously and embrace new energy efficient technologies. Strong pollution control laws also encourage industries to switch to cleaner fuel sources such as natural gas. The Singapore Government facilitates the adoption of energy efficient technologies through grants and other policy tools to overcome high upfront capital investments and other non-market barriers. Singapore is already among the 20 best-performing countries in terms of emissions intensity, based on data published by the International Energy Agency(IEA)in 2019.3This reflects the substantial early action Singapore has taken to grow in an environmentally responsible way. While Singapore will continue to strive for sustainable growth, it will be increasingly challenging for Singapore to achieve additional deep emissions reductions. Singapore is continuing to invest significantly in research and development to harness the potential of low-carbon technologies and explore effective international cooperation;<br>f) Singapore is pushing ahead on solar deployment despite constraints. Singapore is pushing ahead to spur the deployment of solar PV through continued investment in research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) to reduce cost, improve efficiency and enable innovative modes of deployment such as floating, offshore, and building-integrated PV. Singapore is well on track to achieve350 megawatt-peak (MWp) in 2020 and aims to achieve at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030. While this level of renewable energy cannot match those of countries with abundant land for solar PV deployment and access to alternative energy resources, Singapore’s context and constraints must be taken into account. 2GWp of solar would require between 1,000 and 2,000 hectares of space, out of Singapore’s land area of 725km2, and would meet about4% of Singapore’s current annual electricity needs, and10% of daily peak electricity demand today;<br>g) Singapore is undertaking concrete implementation efforts. Singapore’s carbon tax, the first in Southeast Asia, came into effect in 2019.The carbon tax is applied to direct emissions from facilities producing 25ktCO2eor more of GHG emissions in a year, without exemption. This covers 80% of Singapore’s carbon emissions and provides an economy-wide price signal to incentivise emissions reductions, supports other mitigation measures and facilitates transition to a low-carbon economy. Singapore is also implementing concrete measures within the various sectors. For example, for the transport sector, Singapore is taking steps to make public and shared transport and active mobility the preferred mode of travel; phase out internal combustion engine vehicles and promote the adoption of cleaner and greener vehicles, such as electric vehicles; and enhance the environmental friendliness of its transport infrastructure. For the buildings sector, Singapore has mandated minimum energy performance standards and developed the Super Low Energy Buildings Programme, which supports the research and adoption of cost-effective, energy-efficient and renewable energy solutions. For industry, Singapore has enhanced its grant schemes to help individual companies improve their energy efficiency, and have sought to bring companies within a sector together to achieve systems-level efficiency gains across the sector;<br>h) Singapore’s climate vulnerabilities will require comprehensive adaptation efforts. As a small, low-lying island state, Singapore’s vulnerabilities to the effects of climate change require it to pursue a comprehensive adaptation programme to protect its coasts, low-lying areas and communities (see Annex for details of Singapore’s adaptation vulnerabilities and strategies). These adaptation actions will impose significant costs for the Singapore Government and people; and <br>i) Singapore is working actively to support other developing countries in their efforts to build capacity for climate efforts. Singapore collaborates actively with international partners, such as the UNFCCC, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), ASEAN and city-networks such as the C40, on sharing of best practices and experiences on climate change and green growth issues. To date, Singapore has trained more than 130,000 officials from fellow developing countries under the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) in key areas such as sustainable development, urban planning, water, and transport management. Singapore also launched a dedicated Climate Action Package under the Singapore Cooperation Programme in 2018, to offer capacity-building support in areas such as climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, flood management, disaster risk reduction, and green climate finance. Singapore will continue to deepen and broaden its technical cooperation programmes with other developing countries.",

    "6b": "Most of the current concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is a result of emissions that have taken place since the Industrial Revolution (the post-1750 period). Current generations are bearing the costs of past interference with the global climate system, resulting from human activities and consequent greenhouse gas emissions, primarily by developed countries, during the last two and a half centuries. In order to build a fair global response to climate change, it is therefore of central importance to establish a connection between cause (anthropogenic emissions) and effect (temperature increase and climate change).<br>The global mean surface temperature increase due to anthropogenic emissions is an objective criterion to measure climate change, serving the purpose of establishing upper limits to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the global climate system. The relative contribution of any individual actor to global climate change can be determined using the global mean surface temperature as an indicator. Each individual actor’s contribution to temperature increases should take into account differences in terms of starting points, population, approaches, economic structures, resource bases, the need to maintain sustainable economic growth, available technologies and other individual circumstances. <br>The reconstruction of the historical series of net anthropogenic emissions allows for the estimation of the relative share of the temperature increase attributable to each individual country, including in per capita terms. The relative responsibility of a given country in relation to the global mean surface temperature increase can be estimated with a high level of confidence. Hence, the marginal relative contribution to the global average surface temperature increase is a relevant measure for evaluating the level of each party’s responsibility in the collective effort to “[h]olding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”, in accordance with Article 2.1 (a) of the Paris Agreement. <br>This understanding provides for the main moral foundation underpinning the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, which is one of the central pillars of the international climate change regime, constituted by the UNFCCC, its Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. <br>Brazil ́s mitigation efforts are of a type, scope and scale at least equivalent to the contributions of developed countries with both greater historical and current responsibilities for climate change. In view of the above, and based on the available analytical tools, it is clear that this NDC is a far more ambitious effort than what would be required by Brazil ́s marginal relative responsibility for global average temperature increases. <br>Indeed, Brazil’s NDC is one of the most ambitious in the world. In addition to the significant values established for its mitigation targets, Brazil is one of the very few countries that have taken on commitments not only for 2030, but also a target for 2025, allowing for better monitoring of the evolution of its mitigation actions.<br>Therefore, Brazil believes it is making an important contribution to international efforts to fight climate change, in both relative and absolute terms.<br>Brazil has 30% of its territory covered by protected areas, comprising both Conservation Units and Indigenous Peoples’ Lands. It also has one of the world’s most protective land-use legislations, which requires land owners to set aside for preservation between 20% and 80% of their respective properties’ area, in addition to conserving riparian forests and other fragile ecosystems. Protected areas, together with areas mandatorily set aside for preservation in private farms, total 50% of the national territory. Put together, protected areas, mandatorily set aside areas and conserved areas amount to more than 60% of the Brazilian territory. <br>The Low Carbon Agriculture Plan (ABC) has already allocated over R$ 17 billion to a wide range of mitigation measures in the agricultural and animal husbandry sector, such as recovery of degraded pastures; biological nitrogen fixation; increased accumulation of organic matter, and therefore carbon, in the soil; no-tillage system; crop-livestock-forestry integration and agroforestry systems; and forest planting. In 2019, renewable sources accounted for 83% of power generation, 46% of automobile fuel consumption, and 41% of primary energy in Brazil, this latter value corresponding to over two and a half times the world average. Production of biofuels for transport keeps growing with the support of the Renovabio Program, which uses decarbonization market mechanisms to foster production and consumption of these renewable resources. The hydroelectric power generation infrastructure accounts for 64% of the national installed capacity, and is the best technological solution to compensate for the intermittence and seasonality of wind, solar and biomass sources, which account for 19% of the power generation installed capacity and are experiencing rapid growth.",
    "6c": "The target of reducing emissions by 43% between 2005 and 2030 represents an increase of 6% compared to the previous target of reducing emissions by 37% between 2005 and 2025. The current target is also consistent with an indicative long-term objective of reaching climate neutrality by 2060.",
    "6d": "Despitebeing  a  developing  country,  Brazil has  already  adopted an  absolute, economy-wide target since it presented its iNDC.",
    "6e": "N/A",
    "7a": "",
    "7b": "By presenting one of the most ambitious NDCs in the world, Brazil understands it is significantly contributing to the \"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”, consistent with Article 2 of the UNFCCC.<br>By the same token, Brazil believes to be contributing to the collective effort to hold \"the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”, consistent with Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement.<br>As per Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement, Brazil presents a sizeable emission reduction target, which largely exceeds any goals related to peaking emissions. Brazil’s NDC is compatible with along-term indicative objective of achieving carbon neutrality in 2060.<br>The Brazilian Federal Government understands that market mechanisms must play a crucial role in the implementation of the objectives of the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement. Through the Floresta+ Program, the Government has set up an ambitious and innovative policy for the payment of environmental services. The program includes a component that refers to the voluntary carbon market, to foster investments in forest conservation projects. Furthermore, Brazil considers it essential that the negotiations on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement be concluded promptly and that the sustainable development mechanism (SDM) provided for under Article 6, paragraph 4 of the Agreement be operationalized as soon as possible. The SDM has the potential to greatly facilitate the implementation of the Paris objectives, both in Brazil and in other countries. On the other hand, in the event of a failure to conclude the negotiations and regulation of Article 6, the entire architecture of the Paris Agreement would be seriously jeopardized, to the detriment of the implementation of its objectives.<br>As of 2021, Brazil will require at least US$ 10 billion per year to address the numerous challenges it faces, including the conservation of native vegetation in its various biomes. Further decisions regarding Brazil’s indicative long-term strategy, especially the definition of the final date to be considered to this end, will take into account financial transfers to be received by the country. Although the Federal Government currently considers achieving carbon neutrality in 2060, the proper functioning of the market mechanisms under the Paris Agreement might justify considering a more ambitious long-term objective in the future, having as a time horizon, for instance, the year 2050."

En línea con ello, la Segunda NDC avanza en el diseño de un enfoque transversal de la dimensión de género a lo largo de los sectores, así como nociones tendientes a garan-tizar la transición justa de la fuerza laboral.

Esta mejora en la calidad de los inventarios consta en un aumento significativo en la superficie representada, mejoras en el método de cálculo y los factores de emisión utilizados, mayor coherencia en la serie tem-poral, una mayor cantidad de fuentes y sumideros incluidos - por ejemplo, emisiones asociadas al uso de lubricantes, grasas y ceras de parafina, y de productos como sustitutos de las sustancias que agotan la capa de ozono -, entre otros. A su vez, representa una mejora en términos de la transparencia de la información incluida al reportar, según los requerimientos de la orientación de Katowice de la Decisión 4/CMA.1 sobre la Claridad, la Transparencia y la Comprensión (ICTU, por sus siglas en inglés).Por último, esta Segunda NDC incorpora nuevas secciones de Ejes Rectores, Medios de Implementación, y Monitoreo y Evalua-ción, las cuales facilitan el entendimiento de la meta a la luz de las circunstancias nacionales del país",

It is a significant increase from the UK’s previous contribution to the EU’s Intended NDC of 40% by 2030, which was estimated to be a 53% UK reduction on reference levels. <br>The level of the NDC is consistent with advice from the CCC. The CCC stated that an NDC of at least 68% ‘would constitute a decisive commitment to a net zero emissions trajectory, consistent with the Paris Agreement’ and ‘would place the UK among the leading countries in climate ambition.’ [CCC advice on the UK’s 2030 NDC https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-advice-on-the-uks-2030-nationally-determined-contribution-ndc/]<br>BEIS led work across UK Government departments to identify the UK’s highest possible ambition, taking account of robust analysis of domestic decarbonisation potential, guidance from the CCC, the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and the equity principles identified in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report.",
    "6b": "The UK’s NDC target level was set taking into account the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and a range of IPCC recognised equity principles. The IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°Csets out global pathways which are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels with limited or no overshoot. These show a reduction in global net anthropogenic GHG emissions of around 45% (40-60% interquartile range) by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. <br>The UK’s NDC targets a more rapid reduction than these global pathways: current estimates suggest that the UK’s NDC would reduce GHG emissions by approximately 58% on 2010 levels. By reducing emissions byat least 68%on reference year levels (1990/1995), UK emissions per person will fall from around 14 tCO2e in 1990 to fewer than 4 tCO2e in 2030. [These estimates are subject to change in line with ongoing improvements to the UK’s national GHG Inventory. Final reference year and target year emissions will be based on the UK 1990-2030 GHG Inventory submitted to the UNFCCC in 2032.]<br>The CCC has advised that an NDC of at least 68% ‘would align with the published pathways from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for a 1.5°C goal.",
    "6c": "The target in the UK’s NDC is an ambitious and continued enhancement in the UK’s mitigation efforts. It represents a progression beyond the UK’s estimated contribution to the Intended NDC previously communicated by the European Union.<br>In 2015, the European Commission and the then Council Presidency communicated a Joint Intended NDC on behalf of the European Union and its Member States (then including the UK) of an at least 40% domestic reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. In its advice on the fifth carbon budget, the CCC estimated that this target implied a reduction in UK emissions of around 53% below 1990 levels. [This reflects estimates for the UK’s emissions allocations in the traded and non-traded sectors.]<br>The UK NDC commits the UK to reducing economy-wide GHG emissions by at least 68% by 2030 compared to reference year levels",
    "6d": "The UK’s NDC is an economy-wide absolute emissions reduction target in compliance with Article 4.4 of the Paris Agreement.",
    "6e": "Not applicable.",
    "7a": "The UK’s NDC represents the UK’s contribution to the objectives of Article 2 of the Convention to stabilise GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Sections 4 and 6 detail the UK’s mitigation ambition that will contribute to achieving Article 2 of the Convention. ",
    "7b": "See Section 4 and 6 on the UK’s legislated commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and how the UK’s NDC contributes to that goal."
